This site is responsive so the displaying differs between mobile , tablet and desktop .

## Used tools 

JavaScript , jQuery , html , php , css and sass .

Using JavaScript :
1- We used 'GET' method of Ajax to automatically show a new quote whenever the user clicked the 'Show Me Another' button .
2- We used 'POST' method of Ajax to submit a new quote to the site , however the user can't submit without being logged in .
3- Successfully submitting a new quote will show a Thank You message .
